CSS GRID:
By the end of this lesson you should be able to:
    compare the basics between Flexbox and Grid.
    Describe a situation for using grid over flexbox.
    Introduced in 2017, grid allows users to place divs in a grid...lol
    Great for easy placement of items in a two-dimensional layout.
    Initially thought to replace flexbox, it instead is another tool in the toolbelt, and
    can sometimes be used in tandem with flexbox for great results.
    gap property is really useful



Grid container:
    Like flexbox, grid uses parent divs to act as containers, with the display:grid property.
    .container{
        display:grid;
    }
    The grid attribute cascades to the IMMEDIATE child elements.
    grid attribute does not cascade down to grandchildren elements.

<div class="container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2
    <p>I am not a grid item!</p>
  </div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
  <div>Item 4</div>
</div>

*<p> does NOT get the grid property.
