Emmet: HTML add-on software that lets you use powerful HTML shortcuts that speed up development time

    Useful Commands:
    ! : boilerplate
    alt + w: Wrapping, allows you to create parent elemnts are the currently selected element.
    alt + r: Remove: remove the currently selected element.

    Creation syntax:
    Can create html elements quickly with combinations of element names, CSS class/id syntax, and > () to nest elements
        e.g. div>p1>button.THEBUTTON
        creates
        <div>
            <p1>
                <button class = "THEBUTTON"><button>
            <p1>
        <div>
        but takes significantly less time to write.
    Parenthesis can be used in the same way as PEMDAS to isolate parts of Emmet input
        e.g. head+(body>p1)+footer would create
        <head><head>
        <body>
            <p1><p1>
        <body>
        <footer><footer>
