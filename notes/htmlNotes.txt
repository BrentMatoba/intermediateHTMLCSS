Emmet: HTML add-on software that lets you use powerful HTML shortcuts that speed up development time

    Useful Commands:
    ! : boilerplate
    alt + w: Wrapping, allows you to create parent elemnts are the currently selected element.
    alt + r: Remove: remove the currently selected element.

    Creation syntax:
    Can create html elements quickly with combinations of element names, CSS class/id syntax, and > () to nest elements
        e.g. div>p1>button.THEBUTTON
        creates
        <div>
            <p1>
                <button class = "THEBUTTON"><button>
            <p1>
        <div>
        but takes significantly less time to write.
    Parenthesis can be used in the same way as PEMDAS to isolate parts of Emmet input
        e.g. head+(body>p1)+footer would create
        <head><head>
        <body>
            <p1><p1>
        <body>
        <footer><footer>



SVG: "Scalable Vector Graphics"
    a form of image that is made of mathmatical equations, as opposed to specified colored pixels. This allows images to be enlarged without
    reducing image quality. The downside of this process it that it rapidly becomes unwieldy with complicated images, making it more useful for
    things like business logos where there is not a high number of details.

    SVG's can be placed in a website with two different methods, linking and embedding
        linked SVG's are cleaner, but can't be accessed from your website, meaning that they cannot be altered.
        embedded SVG's are more work and can clutter your code, but allow you access to the image, meaning it can be altered with XML

XML: "Extensible Markup Language"
    SVG is written in XML as opposed to binary. This language can be interacted with and altered in order to alter the image.
    svg xmlns: "XML NameSpace" specifies the dialect of XML being used, some browsers need this to properly load the image.
    viewBox: Defines the bounds of your image
    class, id: functions the exact same as it does in HTML and CSS
    base elements: <circle>, <rect>, <path>, and <text> are the basic building blocks of SVG
    SVG attributes: such as <fill> and <stroke> can be altered with CSS
