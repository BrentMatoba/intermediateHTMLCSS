Default Styles and Resets:
Browser each their own unique minimal styling that is applied to any HTML. For example, links in chrome are blue if no css is appliied!
These default styles are relatively small but CAN create small problems, interefering with your CSS.
To counter this, web developers often use a "reset" to cancel out the browser's default styles and start with a truly neutral HTML, allowing for websites to
perform more consistently across different browsers.
This isn't always used, since the default styling is usually there for good reason, and the programmer will have to manually recreate
a lot of the default styling later anyways.
There are various reset methods with different degrees of changes, but the Meyers reset is by far the most common method.
