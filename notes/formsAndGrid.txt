Forms: The main way you collect information from users. Forms are the gateway for users into your backend services.
    Think amazon! Delivery forms, payment forms etc.


The form element: a container element, wraps all of the inputs a user will interact with on a form.

A form element takes two essential attributes, action and method.
    action: takes a URL value t hat tells the form where it should send its data to be processed.
        This will be revisted later in the curriculum on how to interact with this element from a backend perspective.
    method: tells the browser which HTTP request method it should use to submit the form. The "GET" and "POST" request methods are the two most common.
        GET: gets information from the server, like search results!
        POST: Makes changes to the server, like when a user makes an account.

form example code:
    <form action="example.com/path" method="post">

    </form>

Form controls: These are the elements needed to make the form inputs that users will interact with, like buttons, checkboxes, and buttons.
    input: The most versatile form control elemlent. Accepts a "type" attribute which tells the browser what type of data it should expect 
        and how it shoudl render the input element.

        example code:
        <form action="example.com/path" method="post">
         <input type="text">
        </form>
