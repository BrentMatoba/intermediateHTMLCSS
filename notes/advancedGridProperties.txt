What do when you want the grid to be dynamic, responsive, and reuseable,
as opposed to static?

Learning outcomes
    Create multiple grid tracks more easily using the repeat function:
    Create grid tracks using fr units instead of an explicit size
    Set min, max, and ideal track size boundaries.
    use auto-fit and auto-fill to create a grid with a dynamic numbers of rows or columns
    use auto-fit/auto-fill along with minmax() to create responsive grids.
