What do when you want the grid to be dynamic, responsive, and reuseable,
as opposed to static?

Learning outcomes
    Create multiple grid tracks more easily using the repeat function:
    Create grid tracks using fr units instead of an explicit size
    Set min, max, and ideal track size boundaries.
    use auto-fit and auto-fill to create a grid with a dynamic numbers of rows or columns
    use auto-fit/auto-fill along with minmax() to create responsive grids.

Setup
display grid: used to turn a container into a grid
"resize: both" is a css property that allows the user to resize the container by clicking and dragging
from the bottom right corner. This will be beneficial to use when we start using properties that resize our grid
tracks based on the size of the grid.

Overflow: auto to enable scrolling if we resize the container to be smaller than our grid can accomodate.

gap/padding establish a "gutter" area to be able to visualize the grid items better.
